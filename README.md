# OutlineKeyGenerator
1. Inputs a CSV list of people and creates Outline keys with the name of the people, and saves them in a CSV file. The input CSV file has to have 3 starting columns for first name, last name, and email address, respectively. The rest of the columns are ignored, but the first 3 ones should be the ones mentioned.
 * One way to generate such a CSV file is to select contacts on contacts.google.com, and then export them to an Outlook CSV file. You can also tag your selected contacts in Google Contacts to keep them for future use.
 * Check out the sample contacts.csv file here.
2. Emails the generated keys to the people listed in the CSV file (WIP).
